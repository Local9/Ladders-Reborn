# Inferno Collection: Ladders - Reborn
[![Build and Check](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Ladders-Reborn/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Ladders-Reborn/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

__Public Alpha Version 1.0__

Following the release of the [original Ladders](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Ladders) back in 2020, Ladders - Reborn is the updated C# version boasting OneSync support, addon Ladder prop instead of replace, Ace permissions, and more efficient code.

"Adds working ladders to FiveM, ideal for Fire Department use. Ladders are stored in a configurable list of vehicles, with each vehicle being able to carry a configurable maximum amount of ladders. The resource includes a custom ladder model as well."

Presently, the following can be customized:
- Vehicle List and Ladder count per vehicle
- Max total ladders

Usage:
- Go up to a vehicle and type `/ladder collect` or `/ladder store`
